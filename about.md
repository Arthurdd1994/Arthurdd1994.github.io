Hey, Iâ€™m Arthur!

I'm a computer guy. The only jobs I've ever had have been in IT. I know my way around a computer pretty well but I'm still learning new things every day.

I'm married to my high school sweetheart Amanda, and we have an amazing son named Elwood.

Remind me to add some more to this in the future ;)
