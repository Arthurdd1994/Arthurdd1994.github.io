Hey, I’m Arthur.

I’m a longtime computer nerd, casual gamer and self-proclaimed audio engineer. I married my high-school sweetheart Amanda in 2015 and we are now expecting a new addition to the family in Q2 2019!

Being interested in computers since a young age I was naturally drawn to a career in Information Technology. Sometimes work doesn’t quite scratch the itch so I find myself continually planning or tinkering on setting up some new server or electronics project, some of which you can find here.

I have always enjoyed video games, but most fell the wayside the last few years getting settled into ‘adult’ life. I recently purchased a Nintendo Switch which has rekindled a love for video games I haven’t had in years.

My newest passion has been in Audio Engineering. My interest began years ago during my time in Show Choir at my High School. Since then I began volunteering at my church [(Crosstown Alliance!)](crosstownalliance.com) on the Tech and Sound teams.
