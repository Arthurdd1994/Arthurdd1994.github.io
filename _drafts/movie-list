title: Arthur's Master Movie To-Do List
---

For years I have tried keeping a master list of movies I need to watch. Any time someone mentions an iconic movie from years past or I hear some pop culture reference that I don't understand I'll add the related movie to my list. I've deleted the list a few times and eventually decide to make another. The only problem is I've never watched anything from this list.

This changes today! I am posting this list online for the world to see and hold me accountable to. This will become my master list which I will update as I find more movies I need to watch. I will post my thoughts on each movie as I watch them as a blog post and link them here. Wish me luck in my endeavor!

1. Office Space
2. Star Wars (I've seen this, it has been YEARS)
3. The Empire Strikes Back
4. Return of the Jedi
5.
