title: Apple and Smart TVs
---

On Sunday Samsung [announced](https://news.samsung.com/us/samsung-smart-tvs-launch-itunes-movies-tv-shows-support-airplay-2-spring-2019/) it will now be offering iTunes and Apple Airplay 2 support on 2019 Smart TV Models this spring, and will also be rolling out a firmware update to 2018 models for the same support. The TVs will be equipped with the "iTunes Movies and TV Shows" app allowing customers to access their iTunes content directly from their television. Stranger still, this new iTunes app will work in conjunction with Samsung's Siri competitor, Bixby.

As if this announcement wasn't surprise enough: on Monday [LG](https://twitter.com/LGUS/status/1082318564399427586), [Vizio](https://www.vizio.com/apple) and [Sony](https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/sony-electronics-adds-super-large-sized-8k-tvs-and-oled-4k-tvs-to-the-master-series-lineup-300774276.html) all also announced many upcoming smart TVs will support Apple's Airplay 2. It is notable, however, that the "iTunes Movies and TV Shows" app was not mentioned, seemingly a Samsung exclusive.

Apple has acknowledged these announcements as well. On their website they now have a [list](https://www.apple.com/ios/home/accessories/#section-tv) of all AirPlay 2-Enables TVs. I will certainly be keeping an eye on this page throughout the coming months looking for changes and additions. Here's the current listing:

This all seems to be leading up to the release of Apple's Netflix competitor, wishing to broaden their audience in an attempt to become a services company. We'll see how this pans out
