These are a few Nerf game types I have collected over time. Iâ€™ve only played a few of them but am dedicated to trying all of them eventually. Expect posts in the future detailing my thoughts on each game type individually.

### 3-15 Deathmatch

This is a classic game type. 2 teams, each team has a re-spawn location. Each player has 3 lives and re-spawn takes 15 seconds.

### Standard Deathmatch

Another classic game type. 2 teams, each has a respawn location. Decide on a time frame and set a timer. When hit with a nerf dart/HIR the player goes to their respawn point, waits 15 seconds and returns to battle. Players keep track of their deaths. The team with the most kills wins/the team with the most deaths loses.

### Zombies

1 player as a zombie, the rest as humans with blasters. The zombie hides, then tags players causing them to also become a zombie. When zombies are shot they must count 10 seconds before they can move again. The goal is to be the last 'human' alive.

### Kill/Confirmed

2-Team Deathmatch, similar to 3-15 Deathmatch. Rather than lives and re-spawn when players are shot they are 'downed' and must sit down and wait for someone to tag them. If an enemy tags them they are out permanently, if a friendly tags them they are revived. Think of this as a form of freeze tag.

### Transfer

2 teams, 2 buckets and a load of balls. The teams start with an equal amount of balls in their buckets. The game ends when one team has all the balls (or the timer sounds). Players can carry 1 ball at a time. If you are shot by your opponent you must stop moving, put your hands up and count out loud 15 seconds. If you were carrying a ball when you were shot you drop it. You may not throw the balls. Set a time limit in case of a stalemate. Whoever has the most balls by the end wins.

### Tower Defense 

2 Teams, 2 bases, 10 Plastic Cups, arranged in 2 towers with 5 cups each. 1 Team attacking, one defending. 1 Cup tower is in a known location, the other hidden somewhere by the defending team. There is a timer set at the beginning of the round, the attacking team's goal is to SHOOT down all the cups before time runs out and the defending team's goal is to protect their cups. When a player is shot they must return to their base with hands up and count to re-spawn. Suggested 10-15 second re-spawns.

### Tank

1 player is a tank. The tank can't die, can't run, and when they are shot they are stunned for 5 seconds (during which they can not move or shoot. Also, any shots they take do NOT reset the stun) All other players are infantry.  When they get tagged they are out for the rest of the game. Infantry's goal is to survive for 5 minutes, after which the tank is now vulnerable to anti-tank missiles (ball-pit balls.) 

### Paranoia

Players draw cards to determine if they are a zombie or not. Plan to have between 10% and 25% of your player base be zombies. Players spread out and a 5 minute timer is started .  Zombies may not use blasters and must put down their weapons before tagging anyone (and thus revealing themselves as a Zombie)  Once this timer runs out an antidote is available. The Humans now move this antidote from one predetermined location to another in order to cure all zombies and win the game. Zombies win if they manage to turn all Humans before the antidote is delivered.
